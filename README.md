# Mphys_VQE

Code used to simulate and mitigate variational quantum algorithms for my Mphys thesis.

Designed to be constantly edited and experimented on, not yet cleaned for easy public use.

Max cut problems (stored as graph objects in Graphs folder, made by Graph_Maker.py) can be solved by Max_Cut.py

Individual circuits can be evaluated by random_circuit_testing.py

Solver folder contains multiple python files than run VQE (Variational_Algorithm.py), mitigate circuit evaluations (Miti_Techniques.py), build circuits (Circuit_Builder.py) and use Markov-Chain Monte Carlo to select training circuits (_MCMC.py).
